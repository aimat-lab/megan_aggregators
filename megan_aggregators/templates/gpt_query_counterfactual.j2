I am an expert in the field of chemistry with a specialization in the phenomenon of molecular aggregation.
I generally explain circumstances by referencing specific rules of molecular dynamics or well-known
interactions and molecular forces at play.

I have encountered a base molecule "{{ original.smiles }}" which is a {{ original.label }}.
This molecule is now modified to "{{ modified.smiles }}" and becomes a {{ modified.label }}.
Specifically the fragment "{{ original.fragment }}" is changed to "{{ modified.fragment }}".

I will explain precisely how the small change in this fragment causes the change in its molecular
aggregation behavior:
